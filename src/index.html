<!--
My overall impression of the project is rather positive. Code is valid, clean and nicely formatted.

Markup is almost semantically correct, but there is a room for improvement. e.g. Using <nav> HTML element for navigation, adding some <article> elements, replacing <div>'s with inner line break tags with <p>.

There are few minor issues with block model and content overflowing, that prevent page from displaying correctly
on mobile devices. (see above)

In terms of BEM methodology, not all classes are named properly and combined css selectors are widely used,
which is allowed, but not encouraged. Unfortunately, the file structure of the project doesn't follow BEM guidelines.
e.g. - 'main' folder contains subfolders of blocks which aren't its elements;
     - Separate 'image' folder;
     - Folders for blocks not used in this particular project;
